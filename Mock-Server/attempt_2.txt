Mock Energy Interface - Basic Validation
==================================================
=== Testing Basic Mock Functionality ===

1. Testing with simple command (java -version):
MOCK MODE: Executing java -version
MOCK: Executed in 0.09s, Energy: 0.92J
   Exit code: 0
   Energy consumed: 0.92 joules

=== Testing GC Strategy Differences ===

2. Testing Serial GC:
MOCK MODE: Executing java -XX:+UseSerialGC -version
MOCK: Executed in 0.14s, Energy: 1.36J
   Energy: 1.36J

2. Testing Parallel GC:
MOCK MODE: Executing java -XX:+UseParallelGC -version
MOCK: Executed in 0.15s, Energy: 2.16J
   Energy: 2.16J

2. Testing G1 GC:
MOCK MODE: Executing java -XX:+UseG1GC -version
MOCK: Executed in 0.08s, Energy: 0.32J
   Energy: 0.32J

   Results summary:
   Serial GC: 1.36J
   Parallel GC: 2.16J
   G1 GC: 0.32J
   All strategies produce different values: True

=== Testing Workload Scaling ===
   Testing light workload...
MOCK MODE: Executing java -XX:+UseG1GC SimpleGCTest light
MOCK: Executed in 0.34s, Energy: 4.70J
   Light workload: 4.70J
   Testing medium workload...
MOCK MODE: Executing java -XX:+UseG1GC SimpleGCTest medium
MOCK: Executed in 0.22s, Energy: 5.45J
   Medium workload: 5.45J
   Testing heavy workload...
MOCK MODE: Executing java -XX:+UseG1GC SimpleGCTest heavy
MOCK: Executed in 0.38s, Energy: 12.98J
   Heavy workload: 12.98J
   Workload scaling correct (light < medium < heavy): True

=== Testing Factory Pattern ===
   Mock mode: Successfully created mock provider
   Real mode: Correctly failed (not implemented yet)

=== Testing CSV Format ===
MOCK MODE: Executing java -version
MOCK: Executed in 0.08s, Energy: 0.84J
   Header: timestamp,energy_joules,power_watts,execution_time
   Data: 1757933187,0.839541,10.261219,0.081817
   CSV format valid: True

==================================================
Test Results Summary:
   Basic Functionality: PASS
   GC Strategy Differences: PASS
   Workload Scaling: PASS
   Factory Pattern: PASS
   CSV Format: PASS

âœ“ All tests passed! Mock interface is working.
  Ready to integrate with ExperimentRunner.
