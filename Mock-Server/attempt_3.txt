Mock Energy Interface - Basic Validation
==================================================
=== Testing Basic Mock Functionality ===

1. Testing with simple command (java -version):
MOCK MODE: Executing java -version
MOCK: Executed in 0.09s, Energy: 0.96J
   Exit code: 0
   Energy consumed: 0.96 joules

=== Testing GC Strategy Differences ===

2. Testing Serial GC:
MOCK MODE: Executing java -XX:+UseSerialGC -version
MOCK: Executed in 0.13s, Energy: 1.20J
   Energy: 1.20J

2. Testing Parallel GC:
MOCK MODE: Executing java -XX:+UseParallelGC -version
MOCK: Executed in 0.13s, Energy: 1.86J
   Energy: 1.86J

2. Testing G1 GC:
MOCK MODE: Executing java -XX:+UseG1GC -version
MOCK: Executed in 0.08s, Energy: 0.33J
   Energy: 0.33J

   Results summary:
   Serial GC: 1.20J
   Parallel GC: 1.86J
   G1 GC: 0.33J
   All strategies produce different values: True

=== Testing Workload Scaling ===
   Testing light workload...
MOCK MODE: Executing java -XX:+UseG1GC SimpleGCTest light
MOCK: Executed in 0.32s, Energy: 4.40J
   Light workload: 4.40J
   Testing medium workload...
MOCK MODE: Executing java -XX:+UseG1GC SimpleGCTest medium
MOCK: Executed in 0.25s, Energy: 6.15J
   Medium workload: 6.15J
   Testing heavy workload...
MOCK MODE: Executing java -XX:+UseG1GC SimpleGCTest heavy
MOCK: Executed in 0.43s, Energy: 14.47J
   Heavy workload: 14.47J
   Workload scaling correct (light < medium < heavy): True

=== Testing Factory Pattern ===
   Mock mode: Successfully created mock provider
   Real mode: Correctly failed (not implemented yet)

=== Testing CSV Format ===
MOCK MODE: Executing java -version
MOCK: Executed in 0.13s, Energy: 1.37J
   Header: timestamp,energy_joules,power_watts,execution_time
   Data: 1759156091,1.372713,10.647314,0.128926
   CSV format valid: True

==================================================
Test Results Summary:
   Basic Functionality: PASS
   GC Strategy Differences: PASS
   Workload Scaling: PASS
   Factory Pattern: PASS
   CSV Format: PASS

âœ“ All tests passed! Mock interface is working.
  Ready to integrate with ExperimentRunner.
