# Energy Efficiency of Java Garbage Collection Strategies

**Green Lab 2025/2026** | MSc Computer Science | Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam

An empirical study investigating the energy-performance trade-offs of Java Garbage Collection strategies (Serial, Parallel, G1) across diverse workloads and JDK implementations.

**For the Replication Package, move towards the Replication_Package directory for instructions and clone the repositiory.**

## Overview

Modern Java applications consume significant energy in production environments, yet garbage collection strategies are typically optimized for performance rather than energy efficiency. This project provides empirical evidence to help developers make energy-aware GC configuration decisions.

**Key Research Questions:**
- Which GC strategy minimizes energy consumption?
- How does workload intensity affect GC efficiency?
- What are the energy-performance trade-offs?
- Do results generalize across JDK implementations?
