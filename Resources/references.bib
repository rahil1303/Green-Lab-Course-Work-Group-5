abstract = {Sustainable computing needs energy-efficient software. This paper explores the potential of leveraging the nature of software written in managed languages: increasing energy efficiency by changing a program’s memory management strategy without altering a single line of code. To this end, we perform comprehensive energy profiling of 35 Java applications across four benchmarks. In many cases, we find that it is possible to save energy by replacing the default G1 collector with another without sacrificing performance. Furthermore, potential energy savings can be even higher if performance regressions are permitted. Inspired by these results, we study what the most energy-efficient GCs are to help developers prune the search space for energy profiling at a low cost. Finally, we show that machine learning can be successfully applied to the problem of finding an energy-efficient GC configuration for an application, reducing the cost even further.},

The diversity of benchmarks is an important asset to evaluate novel approaches for effectiveness and weaknesses. In this paper, we describe the memory characteristics and the GC behavior of commonly used Java benchmarks, i.e., the DaCapo benchmark suite, the DaCapo Scala benchmark suite and the SPECjvm2008 benchmark suite. The paper can serve as a useful guide to select benchmarks in accordance with desired application characteristics on modern virtual machines as well as with different compilers and garbage collectors. It also helps to put results that are based on these benchmarks into perspective. Additionally, we compare Java's current default collector to the G1 GC.},
