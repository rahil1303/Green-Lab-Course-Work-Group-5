Pre_Check Script:

-> This pre-check script = “DUT health checklist.”

-> Laptop (Linux DUT) → runs workloads & collects RAPL energy.

-> Raspberry Pi → remote orchestrator that schedules and collects runs.

-> You execute the script once before the multi-night campaign to ensure everything (Java, RAPL, EnergiBridge, SSH, CPU governor) is perfect.
