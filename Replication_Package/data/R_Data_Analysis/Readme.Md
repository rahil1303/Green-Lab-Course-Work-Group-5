# Statistical Analysis in R â€” Java GC Energy Efficiency

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

This directory contains the **statistical modeling and inference** for Assignment 3, advancing from exploratory patterns (Python EDA) to formal hypothesis testing using **Linear Mixed-Effects Models (LMMs)**. The analysis answers four research questions about garbage collection (GC) energy efficiency in Java applications.

## ðŸŽ¯ Research Questions Addressed

1. **RQ1:** Which GC strategy (Serial, Parallel, G1) minimizes energy consumption?
2. **RQ2:** How does workload level (Light/Medium/Heavy) influence GC energy efficiency?
3. **RQ3:** What are the energy-performance trade-offs for each GC strategy?
4. **RQ4:** How does JDK implementation (OpenJDK vs Oracle) affect outcomes?

## ðŸ”¬ Analytical Approach

- **Mixed-Effects Models** account for repeated measures across 8 Java applications (subjects)
- **Post-hoc contrasts** (Tukey-adjusted) provide pairwise GC comparisons
- **Effect size analysis** (Cohen's d) quantifies practical significance beyond p-values
- **Interaction testing** examines whether GC performance depends on workload or application type
- **Bootstrap resampling** and **equivalence tests** validate findings with robust inference

## âœ¨ Key Findings (Optimistic Highlights)

âœ… **Parallel GC emerges as efficiency leader** â€” consistent energy advantage (4% lower than G1) compounds to meaningful savings at scale

âœ… **No energy-performance trade-offs** â€” faster execution correlates with lower energy (r = 0.31), enabling win-win optimization

âœ… **Workload management offers 5Ã— greater impact** than GC tuning â€” complementary optimization levers

âœ… **JDK implementation agnostic** â€” OpenJDK and Oracle perform identically (p = 0.62), providing deployment flexibility

âœ… **Application-specific insights** â€” service apps show 20% GC sensitivity where benchmarks show none, guiding targeted optimization
